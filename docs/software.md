    üõ°Ô∏è [**EDS-Pseudo**](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aphp/eds-pseudo?style=social)](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo)
    ---
    EDS-Pseudo is a hybrid model for detecting personally identifying entities in clinical reports. We also provide a pretrained, open-source model as part of this project.

    üìÑ [**EDS-PDF**](https://github.com/aphp/edspdf) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aphp/edspdf?style=social)](https://github.com/aphp/edspdf)
    ---
    EDS-PDF is a generic, pure-Python framework for text extraction from PDF documents. It provides the machinery to use rule- or machine-learning-based approaches to classify text blocs between body and meta-data.

    ‚öôÔ∏è [**Confit**](https://github.com/aphp/confit) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aphp/confit?style=social)](https://github.com/aphp/confit)
    ---
    Confit is a complete and easy-to-use configuration framework aimed at improving the reproducibility of experiments by relying on the Python type annotations, minimal configuration files and a robust CLI.

    üì¶ [**FoldedTensor**](https://github.com/aphp/foldedtensor) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aphp/foldedtensor?style=social)](https://github.com/aphp/foldedtensor)
    ---
    A PyTorch extension that provides efficient handling of tensors containing deeply nested sequences variable sizes.


Here are some personal side projects I have developed in my spare time or as part of my PhD thesis.
