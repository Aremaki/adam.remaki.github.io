</div>

I’m Adam Remaki, currently a PhD student in biomedical NLP at Sorbonne Université since 2023, under the supervision of Xavier Tannier. I hold a double degree: an engineering diploma from CentraleSupélec and a Master of Science in Applied Statistics from Imperial College London (2021).

Before starting my PhD, I worked for two years as a data scientist in the AP-HP Digital Services Department (Direction des Services Numériques, DSN) where I contributed to the development of AI solutions for AP-HP’s clinical data warehouse (the largest in Europe). I was also providing scientific and technical support across multiple healthcare research project.

My research focuses on biomedical information extraction from clinical notes, with the goal of improving the analysis and usability of electronic health records (EHRs). Throughout my PhD, I remain committed to advancing public healthcare through AI.
